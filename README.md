It this project, we create an AI that uses different adversial techniques (minimax and alpha-beta) for a deterministic game with perfect information. The game is called *Line'em Up*. It is a generic version of Tic-Tac-Toe.

In this game, we used Python 3.7. You can run the game by runnig the .py file with Cpython or Pypy.
